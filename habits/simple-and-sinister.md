title: Simple and Sinister KettleBell - Daily Habit
---

## Periodicity 

I intent do do it most of the days in 2017. Stopping when travelling.

I have used KBs in the pass but I have never made it a habit.

I've choosed to do S&S coz it the same everyday; it can be done everyday.

I can do it indoors, so there are no weather excuses.

Only issue may be when travelling, I will have too look for a replacement routing, may be a rountine from freeletics.

### [Start] - 17 Dec 2016 

Daily since the 17 Dec 2016. Attempting to build a habit. Going for 21 days in a row.

Started using the 12kg KB for warm up and get ups and the 16 for swings.

I try to do the S&S first thing in the morning.

### [15+ days in] - 2 Jan 2017

Currently able to do some of the swings with 24kg KB (maybe 3 out of 10) and the get ups with the 16kg. Warm up still with 12Kg. 

The 24Kg feels really heavy. The get ups with the 16kg require a bit more of concentration than with the 12kg.

I hope I will need to buy a 32Kg kettlebell in a few months.

My back feels great. I had some issues with my right shoulder with the one hand swings at the begining is all gone away by concentrating in keeping it in place while swinging

I've to improve with the streching during the day, which I never do.
