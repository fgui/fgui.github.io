title: Simple and Sinister KettleBell - Daily Habit
---

## Periodicity 

I intent do do it most of the days in 2017. Stopping when travelling.

I have used KBs in the pass but I have never made it a habit.

I've choosed to do S&S coz it the same everyday; it can be done everyday.

I can do it indoors, so there are no weather excuses.

Only issue may be when travelling, I will have too look for a replacement routing, may be a rountine from freeletics.
