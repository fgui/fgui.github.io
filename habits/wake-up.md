title: Wake Up Early - Daily Habit
---

## Wake up at 5 o'clock

### require - things that will help me to achive this goal

* Go to sleep early between 9 and 10ish
* No snoozing or thinking on wake up, no checking time on phone or watch. Just do it.
* Morning rotine -> water, dress, [execise](../simple-and-sinister/), breakfast, shower, start work on MIT.

### ok here we go 21 days to make it a habit.

* I've done this previously for 10 days in a row and on and off.
* Day one will be 2 Dec 2017. Will update my success in a few days.
* I've done/attempted 4:30 in the pass but Betsey says I should make it easier for my and do 5 o'clock, I think she is right.
