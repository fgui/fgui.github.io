# Track hours 

Basically track every day the hours spend at work or work related (studing, writing etc).

Mainy track those hours spend with the computer on or near the computer.

Has to be usefull to build billing sheets later.

Doesn't need to be a log of what I do. I use emacs journal for that.

## Software

I considered using org-mode in emacs or other. But it was to much work at the moment.
I am using the Hamster software which seems to me very simple and intuitive. I've use the software in the pass with great success.
