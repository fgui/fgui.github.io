## test with ipad/android

- install expo app in both devices.
- create a test project
  * lein new expo my-project 
  * cd my-project
  * yarn install
  * lein figwheel
- install and run expo
  * npm install -g expo
  * exp start (from the project folder)
- scan barcode from devices
- shake device to set no auto-reloading because figwheel does that for us.
